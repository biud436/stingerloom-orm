/**
 * @internal Settles a `where(column, operator, value)` call made with three
 * arguments whose value is `undefined`.
 *
 * The builders pick the overload by `value === undefined`, so the call was
 * read as the two-argument `where(column, value)` form and compared the
 * column to the operator string: `where("id", ">", maybeId)` ran
 * `"id" = '>'`. On SQLite that matched nothing; on MySQL a numeric column
 * compares `'>'` as 0 and matches the rows whose value is 0.
 *
 * - `IS NULL` / `IS NOT NULL` take no value: returns `null`, which the caller
 *   passes as the value so the operator form is used.
 * - Any other string second argument throws `InvalidQueryError`, whether or not
 *   the builder resolves it as an operator. A string the builder does not
 *   recognise (`"NOT BETWEEN"`, `"=>"`) is rejected outright with a defined
 *   value, so demoting the same call to an equality against the operator text
 *   when the value is `undefined` would leave exactly the silent wrong SQL this
 *   guard removes. The suggestion names the two-argument spelling for a caller
 *   who did mean the string as a value.
 * - A second argument that is not a string cannot be an operator, so the call
 *   is the two-argument form with a stray third argument (a forwarding wrapper,
 *   say): returns `undefined`, the call keeps its two-argument meaning, and it
 *   builds the SQL the two-argument call builds.
